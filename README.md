# BruhOS

I tried making an OS in [assembly-fun](https://github.com/soumitradev/assembly-fun). I failed. The code was crusty. This is my second attempt I guess.

I'm using the [limine bootloader](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) with the stivale protocol.

Currently, you can just run `make run` to run it, but later I'll move to a cross compiler.
